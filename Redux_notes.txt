#Redux : 


Steps :

->Create Action Creators which will return actions.

->Create reducers 
	-import {combineReducers} from "redux";

	-Combine the reducers and export them 
		export default combineReducers({
			songs:songsReducer,
			selectedSong:selectedSongReducer
		})

->Import Provider,createStore inside index.js and wrap App inside provider and pass createStore(reducers) to the provider.


	import {Provider} from "react-redux"
	import {createStore} from "redux"
	
	
	<Provider store={createStore(reducers)}>
		<App />
	</Provider>
	
->Import connect inside component where we want to use the reducers and actions (states).

		import { connect } from "react-redux";
		
	-create mapStateToProp function and wrap with connect function .
	
		const mapStateToProps=(state)=>{
			console.log(state);
			return {selectedSong:state.selectedSong}
		}

		export default connect(mapStateToProps)(SongDetail);
		
	-If also want to use action then import action and pass as object in second argument of connect.
	
		import {selectSong} from "../actions";
	
		export default connect(mapStateToProps,{selectSong})(Songlist);

->console.log(props) you get all the state and function from that.
