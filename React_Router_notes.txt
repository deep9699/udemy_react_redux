#React - Router 

1) Install React router DOM

->npm install --save react-router-dom

2)import BrowserRouter and route from the react-router-dom.

import {BrowserRouter,Route,Link} from "react-router-dom";


3)wrap App inside the BrowserRouter component and pass the path and component as prop in Route component.

   <BrowserRouter>
        <div>
            <Route path="/" exact component={page1} /> 
			
			//exact checks the exact path if we remove exact than component page1 will also display with component page2 when path is page2.
			
			<Route path="/page2" component={page2} />
		</div>
   </BrowserRouter>
   
4)set a link for another router inside the Link.

->first import Link from react-router-dom.	
	import {BrowserRouter,Route,Link} from "react-router-dom";
	
->then set a router navigation using Link.
	<Link to="/page2">Navigate to page 2</Link>
	
->Do not use <a href="/page2" /> for navigation because it will request for the new page and it causes that all the pages will be refreash and all the state will assign it's default value.
	
	
	
=>There are 3 types of Router in react-router-dom.

1)BrowserRouter : Use everything after the TLD or port as the path.

e.g :
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/page2

2)HashRouter :  Uses everything after # as the path

e.g :
http://localhost:3000/#/
http://localhost:3000/#/page2

3)MemoryRouter : Doesn't use the URL to track navigation. (URL will be same in all the cases )

e.g :
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/
